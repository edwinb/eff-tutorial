\section{Introduction}

Pure functional languages with dependent types such as \Idris{} (\url{http://idris-lang.org/}) support reasoning about programs directly in the type system, promising that we can \emph{know} a program will run correctly (i.e.\ according to the specification in its type) simply because it compiles.
Realistically, though, things are not so simple: programs have to interact with the outside world, with user input, input from a network, mutable state, and so on.
In this tutorial I will introduce the \effects{} library, which is included with the \Idris{} distribution and supports programming and reasoning with side-effecting programs, supporting mutable state, interaction with the outside world, exceptions, and verified resource management.

This tutorial assumes familiarity with pure programming in \Idris{}, as described in Sections~1--6 of the main tutorial~\cite{idris-tutorial}\footnote{You do not, however, need to know what a monad is. A correctness property of this tutorial is that the word ``monad'' should appear exactly twice, both in this footnote.}.
The examples are tested with \Idris{} version \version{}.

Consider, for example, the following introductory function which illustrates the kind of properties which can be expressed in the type system:

\begin{code}
vadd : Vect n Int -> Vect n Int -> Vect n Int
vadd []        []        = []
vadd (x :: xs) (y :: ys) = x + y :: vadd xs ys
\end{code}

This function adds corresponding elements in a pair of vectors.
The type guarantees that the vectors will contain only elements of type \texttt{Int}, and that the input lengths and the output length all correspond.
A natural question to ask here, which is typically neglected by introductory tutorials, is ``How do I turn this into a program?''.
That is, given some lists entered by a user, how do we get into a position to be able to apply the  \texttt{vadd} function? Before doing so, we will have to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Read user input, either from the keyboard, a file, or some other input device.
\item Check that the user inputs are valid, i.e.\ contain only \texttt{Int}s and are the same length, and report an error if not.
\item Write output
\end{itemize}

The complete program will include side-effects for I/O and error handling, before we can get to the pure core functionality.
In this tutorial, we will see how \Idris{} supports side-effects.
Furthermore, we will see how we can use the dependent type system to \emph{reason} about stateful and side-effecting programs.
We will return to this specific example later.

\subsection{Hello world}

To give an idea of how programs with effects look in \Idris{}, here is the ubiquitus ``Hello world'' program, written using the \effects{} library:

\begin{code}
module Main
  
import Effect.StdIO
  
hello : { [STDIO] } Eff IO ()
hello = putStrLn "Hello world!"
  
main : IO ()
main = run hello
\end{code}

\noindent
As usual, the entry point is \texttt{main}.
All \texttt{main} has to do is invoke the \texttt{hello} function which supports the \texttt{STDIO} effect for console I/O, runs in the \texttt{IO} context, and returns the unit value.
The details of the \texttt{Eff} type will be presented in the remainder of this tutorial.

To compile and run this program, \Idris{} needs to be told to include the \effects{} package, using the \texttt{-p} \effects{} flag (this flag is required for all examples in this tutorial):

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=^]
$ idris hello.idr -o hello -p ^\effects{}^
$ ./hello
Hello world!
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Outline}

The tutorial is structured as follows: first, in Section~\ref{sect:state}, we will discuss state management, describing why it is important and introducing the \effects{} library to show how it can be used to manage state. This section also gives an overview of the syntax of effectful programs.
Section~\ref{sect:simpleff} then introduces a number of other effects a program may have: I/O; Exceptions; Random Numbers; and Non-determinism, giving examples for each, and an extended example combining several effects in one complete program.
Section~\ref{sect:depeff} introduces \emph{dependent} effects, showing how states and resources can be managed in types.
Section~\ref{sect:impleff} shows how new effects can be implemented.
Section~\ref{sect:hangman} gives an extended example showing how to implement a ``mystery word'' guessing game, using effects to describe the rules of the game and ensure they are implemented accurately.
References to further reading are given in Section~\ref{sect:further}.
